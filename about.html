                I'm Mateo - a software engineer and computer science graduate based in Prague, Czech Republic. I'm primarily intersted in
                <span class="text-highlight">Artificial Intelligence</span>, <span class="text-highlight">deep learning</span>, 
                solving hard problems and basically anything related to technology & science.

                My goal is to understand the nature of intelligence while providing value to others by building intelligent systems and sharing my knowledge.

                <p>
                Apart from AI, I also do some web development, spend too much time on my Linux setup,
                tinker with old computers and read widely, even (and especially) beyond tech topics.
                </p>
                <br>
                I'm keen on applying AI research and theories in real-world scenarios and <span class="text-highlight">
                I am looking for R&D opportunities</span>, especially in advanced intelligent systems, theories of intelligence,
                learning and consciousness, and areas like AGI, computer vision, and NLP.
